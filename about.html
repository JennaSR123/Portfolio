    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><img class="image_resized" style="float:right;margin-left:25px;width:30%;" src="images/jenna.jpg" alt="Jenna at the Temple of Peace">Hi, I'm Jenna. I'm a web designer, front end developer, and photographer based in the New England area. I like hibiscus flowers and the color red. I don't talk much about myself, but here's a photo me of at the Temple of Peace at the Tower Hill Botanical Garden on a Nikon D780.</p>
    <h2 class="left">Okay, but why hire me?</h2>
    <p>I might look young, but I've got nearly a decade of professional experience under my belt. I've been on the Web for two-thirds of its lifespan and I remember when advertisements were a duck hunt Flash game that downloaded a virus if you clicked on it. I also remember being able to look up a recipe on my phone without being completely bombarded with advertisements to the point of uselessness. I am a strong advocate for the usage of ad blockers on both a device and network level. I believe in clean, private, and accessible design free of aggressive marketing and tracking.</p>
	<p>The majority of my work is at a university and government level; I provide refreshing designs for often-stale web environments with a keen eye to accessibility and legal guidelines. In my work, I primarily focus on adding room to breathe and process information by prioritizing visual hierarchy and use of white space. </p>
    <h2 class="left">Credentials</h2>
    <p>It all started a decade ago by taking the Multimedia Communications track at Blackstone Valley Tech. From there, I graduated from Massachusetts Bay Community College with an A.S. in Computer Information Systems, a certificate in Web Design, and a certificate in Cyber Security. On top of that, I'm still slowly earning my B.S. in Information Technology at UMass Lowell, one course at a time. I'm also pursing accessibility certification through WCAG and a Front End Web Developer certificate for Drupal through Acquia.</p>
    <p>Right now, I can confidently write HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, SQL, and a bit of jQuery, Java, and Python. I primarily work in Drupal these days, but I am intimately familiar with managing raw HTML through FTP.</p>
