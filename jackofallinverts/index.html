    <p>Salutations from the East Coast! I‚Äôm FN77, the Jack of all Invertebrates.</p>
	<p>Since I was little I‚Äôve always been obsessed with bugs. I started by raising butterflies and have been working with Lepidoptera since. For over a decade I‚Äôve been raising Bold Jumping Spiders. Isopods, Roaches, and Mantises have been a more recent undertaking over the last 4 years. Mantises specifically have been a passion since Nike, my late Carolina Mantis (Stagmomantis carolina) baffled me and contributed to science by being the first recorded instance of her genus to display parthenogenesis - virgin birth. After finding out, through the help of Discord, the bountiful menagerie of communities, I became inspired to share my invertebrates and educate the public about the importance of all species. I graduated in 2020 with a degree in Captive Wildlife Care and Education, and like it or not, bugs are wildlife. I hope to curate information about various invertebrates, contribute to entomological science, and expand my horizons as a keeper.</p>
